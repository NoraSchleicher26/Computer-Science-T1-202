#Boolean Expression
#Kind of like a mathematical formula
#Can only evaluate to True or False
#Are my shoes tied? = True
#Is 5 > 7 = False
print(5>7)  # = False

#Comparison operators! == < > <= >=
#Kind of like arithmetic operators! = - / * ** % //
x = 5       #SET x equal to 5. tell it what to be
print(x == 5)       #GET x equals 5, ask a question
#The difference is that we are using one or two equal signs
#This is a PERFECT test question

print(4 >= 2) #True
print(1993 == 1993) #True
print(-90 < -99) #False
print(10 != 10) #False, "bash" "not"

#Boolean Expressions Quiz:
answer1 = int(input("Give me a number that is negative\n-"))
print(answer1 < 0)

answer2 = input("Write the number 5\n-")
# answer2 = int(answer2) This is unnecessary
print (answer2 == 5)

print("Walrus" == "Walrus")  # == is totally valid for 2 strings
